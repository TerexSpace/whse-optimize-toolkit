## The Recommended Message (Copy & Paste)

**PR Title:**
```
WMS-OptLab: An open-source toolkit for optimization of ERP warehouse modules
```

**PR Description (Recommended SHORT VERSION):**

```markdown
## Summary

I am submitting **WMS-OptLab**, an open-source Python toolkit for modeling,
optimizing, and evaluating warehouse logistics operations integrated with
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Warehouse Management Systems (WMS).

## Repository

https://github.com/TerexSpace/whse-optimize-toolkit

## Overview

WMS-OptLab provides modular, extensible implementations of warehouse
optimization algorithms (slotting, routing, batching) with ERP/WMS data
integration, scenario analysis, and comprehensive testing.

**Code**: 1,148 lines across 8 specialized modules
**Tests**: 4 modules with GitHub Actions CI/CD
**Documentation**: Type hints, docstrings, README, CONTRIBUTING.md, notebooks
**License**: MIT (OSI-approved)

## Research Contribution

Warehouse picker travel accounts for >50% of fulfillment effort, yet no
integrated open-source toolkit existed for combined warehouse optimization.
WMS-OptLab fills this gap by providing:

- Multiple optimization algorithms (heuristic, exact, metaheuristic)
- ERP/WMS data adapters for real-world validation
- Scenario analysis framework for policy comparison
- Extensible architecture for research contributions
- Reproducible, peer-reviewable implementations

## Features

- **Slotting**: ABC-popularity heuristics and MILP optimization
- **Routing**: S-shape policy and TSP approximation
- **Batching**: Heuristics and simulated annealing metaheuristic
- **Analysis**: What-if scenarios and KPI reporting
```
